Java is a language that "makes it do something". Handling dynamic content and events on browsers. A click, page finished loading, are events in Java. 
Dynamic content is like getting dating from a weather site.
Java script is know is a interprative language. Like if there a build step before your code can run, as in the browser, and do you need something else to make it go.
