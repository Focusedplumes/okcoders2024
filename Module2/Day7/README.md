# Day 7

## the for loop - The idea is to iterating, doing things over and over again. Repeated actions, like every item in a list, examing some collection to work over and over again. 

console list = ["foo, "bar", "baz"]
common syntax is for ( let i=0; i < list.lenght; i++) {
    console.log(list[i]);
<!-- } Make sure to get an i++ in your for loop or an infinite loop or while loop will occurr and crash your browser or PC. Make sure to understand this one -->

<!-- while loop while (index < list.lenght) { console.log(list[index]); index++}

do loop do {console.log(list[index]);}while(false); --> -->


### 99 bottles revisited

### FizzBuzz revisited

## the forEach method on arrays // for when you want to do stuff for each item in an array. 

## using looping to create our coffee shop menu and shopping cart


## try to get comfortable with for each and for loop too.
